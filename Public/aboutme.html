    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I am Jesús Noel Ramírez Herrera, an electronic and 
        communications engineer based in the Distrito Nacional, Dominican Republic. I graduated from the Universidad Tecnológica de Santiago (UTESA), where I developed a strong foundation in electronics and specialized in areas such as residential and industrial electrical installation, PLC programming, and network administration. I am committed to continuous professional development and aim to apply my skills and knowledge in dynamic work environments. Additionally, I am proficient in office software, accounting, and AUTOCAD, which allows me to be a versatile asset to any technical team. Passionate about innovation and problem-solving, I aspire to contribute to projects 
        that enhance technological solutions in my community.</p>

<p>I have worked as a Technical Support Specialist at the National Office of Seismic Evaluation and Infrastructure Vulnerability (ONESVIE) from July 2020 to January 2021, where I provided essential IT support for various projects. Following that, I joined Edesur Dominicana S.A. in January 2020 as a Project Technician, where I contributed to the implementation and management of electrical projects while ensuring high standards of technical excellence. Since January 2024, I have taken on the role of Electromechanical Supervisor at Edesur Dominicana, where I oversee the coordination and execution of electromechanical projects, further enhancing my expertise in the field. My roles have allowed me to hone my problem-solving skills and technical expertise in dynamic work environments.</p>
